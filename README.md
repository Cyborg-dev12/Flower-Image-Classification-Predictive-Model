Flower Classification Model ðŸŒ¸

Overview:

This repository contains a machine learning-based Flower Classification Model designed to classify flowers into species using two approaches:

  Random Forest Classifier: For numerical input features like sepal/petal length and width (based on the Iris dataset).
  
  MobileNetV2 CNN: For image-based flower classification using a pre-trained deep learning model.

Features:

Structured Data Classification: Input features include sepal and petal dimensions.

Image Classification: Upload flower images to predict species.

High Accuracy: Both models achieve high accuracy, making the app useful for botanical studies, gardening tools, or educational purposes.
